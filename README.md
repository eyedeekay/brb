Modern-looking, no fuss Irc2P
-----------------------------

BRB(Blue Rubber Band) Wraps khlieng/dispatch in a WebView, configures 
both for I2P, and keeps it on your system tray. It's OK if that means
nothing to you right now, because what it actually means is that this
is the easiest-to-configure Anonymous IRC client.
